Part one of this huge abstract project

= Need To Have =

*Project Plan

The goal of phase one of the project is to establish an interface into Distributed Communication(?) of Command Objects between nodes in a HyPEER Web (TM)

*Code

This was how we were planning on splitting the first part up
||TJ Young||Stephen Quebe||Ben Dilt||Joel Day||
||CMD Obj||Socket Comms||Reflection||Serialization||

If any one part ends up taking more than a few hours to do, stop and we will re-divide that piece.

*Javadoc (or whatever for C#)

*Style Guidelines

*Testing


*UML Diagram

We need to figure out how we are going to collaborate on this.  Any suggestions?

= What It Is =

== Use Case ==
X.C(....);

with object X and command C we want to invoke a command C whether X is on the current machine or not.  If x is on the current machine C is invoked directly. Otherwise the machine containing X is found C is executed on that machine and the result is returned.
