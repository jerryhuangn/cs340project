Project 1 Meeting with Dr. Woodfield - 27 January 2010

Project management

- Should track actual end dates.

- Should track dependencies.

UML

- Add a class class and a proxy class to the UML diagram with a 1 to 1 relationship.

- Make the UML diagram look like the diagram Woodsfield drew on the board.

Use Case

- Can you give the use case to someone and generate test cases from it and see if it worked or not?

- Add the part about the proxy. How can I test this using the proxy class?

- Good semantics, but give better names for the cases in the use case description.

- You don't need to describe this executing on the current machine.

- In English there is little or no difference between the semantics and the description.

Code

- Did you use the language features?

- Later on Woodfield is going to look to see if we did good blackbox testing and whitebox 
testing.

- We each need to show the basic concepts of blackbox and whitebox testing.

Code Style

- Each class we need the name of the person responsible for maintaining it.

- I think we should probably divide and organize the classes.

- Remove the documentation from the code.

Report

- Next time we need to make a report.

Documentation

- Matt will make sure all of the testing is done.

- Dr.  Woodfield will later test
