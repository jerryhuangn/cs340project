#summary Part 2A of the project

= Requirements =

Add functionality to Add a node to a hypercube.


= Details =

  * There is no centralized controller.
  * given an address, all nodes with smaller values must exist.

=== Algorithm for finding a node ===

{{{
  * c  = child
  * p  = parent
  * os = opposite surrogate (complement)
  * on = opposite natural (complement)
  * n  = neighbor
}}}
----

If you find and Edge Node that points to a surrogate, Insert is between Edge's Parent +1 and the surrogate. 

  # contact node and state that you want to be its child
  # create node with binary value with leading 1 (ex: 00 => parent of 10)
  # parent passes surrogates and natural neighbors
  # new node contacts all the surrogates and natural neighbors and tells them to update (?)
